I’m Rem RunGu Lin, a practical artist and researcher with a Master of Architectural Design from MIT, currently pursuing a PhD in Computational Media and Arts at HKUST (GZ) and serving as a visiting lecturer at the China Academy of Art. My work explores the intersections of XR, media theory, and AI co-creativity, blending research with creative practice to create human-centered experiences in play, performance, well-being, education, and cultural heritage. I envision futures shaped by the entangled assemblage of mind, body, AI, and robotics—opening new pathways for creativity, connection, and somaesthetic becoming. My research has been published in SIGGRAPH, LEONARDO, SIGGRAPH Asia, VCIBA, IEEE VIS AP, CHI PLAY, ISEA, and VINCI, with artworks exhibited at Ars Electronica, SIGGRAPH Asia XR, ISEA Creative Work, IEEE VIS AP Art Gallery, DIGITAL ART CHINA, VINCI Art Gallery, R.A.W.!, the Bi-City Biennale of Urbanism/Architecture, and the Shenzhen Light Art Museum.
