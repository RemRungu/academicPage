I’m Rem RunGu Lin, a practical artist and researcher with a master’s degree from MIT, currently pursuing a PhD in Computational Media and Art at HKUST (GZ). My work explores the intersections of embodied interaction, brainmedia, and AI co-creativity, blending research with creative practice and philosophy. My current research focuses on three key areas: Media as Art, which examines how technological philosophy and emerging media can be applied to design and art to enhance creative practices; Human as Media, where I investigate the entanglement of body, mind, and media, and how this dynamic system can inspire new forms of perception, cognition, and communication; and Space as Media, which extends the concept of human-machine-space symbiosis through spatial computing and social computing. My future goal is to unleash both individual and collective creativity by deepening our understanding of the evolving roles of humans and AI in the bio-digital future. My research has been published in SIGGRAPH, LEONARDO, SIGGRAPH Asia, VCIBA, IEEE VIS AP, CHI PLAY, ISEA, and VINCI. My artworks have been exhibited at ISEA Creative Work, SIGGRAPH ASIA XR, Ars Electronica, IEEE VIS AP Art Gallery, DIGITAL ART CHINA, VINCI Art Gallery, R.A.W.!, Bi-City Biennale of Urbanism/Architecture, Shenzhen Light Art Museum, and more.
