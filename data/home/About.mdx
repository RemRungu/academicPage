I’m Rem RunGu Lin, a digital artist, researcher, and technologist with a master’s degree from MIT, currently pursuing a PhD in Computational Media and Art at HKUST (GZ). My work explores the intersections of embodied interaction, brainmedia, and media theory, blending research with creative practice. My current research focuses on three key areas: Media as Art, exploring how media theory can be applied to art and design to augment creative practices; Human as Media, investigating the entanglement of body and mind and how this relationship can be expressed through digital art; and Space as Media, extending the concept of human-machine-space symbiosis to create immersive, interactive bio-digital spatial entities. My ultimate goal is to unleash our individual and collective creativity by deepening our understanding of the evolving role of humans in the bio-digital future.
My research has been published in SIGGRAPH, LEONARDO, SIGGRAPH Asia, VCIBA, IEEE VIS AP, CHI PLAY, ISEA, and VINCI. My artworks have been exhibited at ISEA Creative Work, SIGGRAPH ASIA XR, Ars Electronica, IEEE VIS AP Art Gallery, DIGITAL ART CHINA, VINCI Art Gallery, R.A.W.!, Bi-City Biennale of Urbanism/Architecture, Shenzhen Light Art Museum, and more.
