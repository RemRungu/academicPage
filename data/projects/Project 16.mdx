## A Mixed Reality Art Performance Ritual that Facilitates Asymmetric Reality Swapping

FungiSync is a somaesthetic mixed reality participatory ritual performance inspired by the cyberdelic culture and fungal wisdom. Participants hold masquerade-style, mushroom-inspired mixed reality masks that each present a distinct, audio-reactive psychedelic overlay, underscoring how technology-mediated realities can become asymmetrical, ultimately hindering our Theory of Mind (ToM) via algorithmic information cocoons and escalating political polarization. The performance revolves around a touch interaction—the handshake, one of the oldest protocols for cooperation—where, upon body contact, participants’ augmented views are exchanged or merged, mirroring how fungi coordinate resource sharing and communication transfering perspectives of non-dualism: you and me, and body and mind. By recontextualizing the handshake ritual, FungiSync highlights the impact of technology-mediated asymmetries and proposes an alternative: fostering non-dualistic discourse reminiscent of mycorrhizal interconnectivity.
