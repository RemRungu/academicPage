## An Immersive Experience Center

A Stone City Without a Script unfolds in three chapters: Creation, State of Mind, and Transformation. A resolute stone descends from the cosmos, towering over the unknown. Intersecting spaces appear and dissolve, enveloped in mist and flickering light, constantly shifting and evolving. The environment transforms alongside these changesâ€”at times revealing itself, at times fading away.
