## A New Media Musical Accepted to R.A.W.!

The story of the musical Still "Ai" is set in a near-future world where artificial intelligence has not only permeated people's daily lives but has also become a part of their emotional lives. Dr. Chad, the protagonist, develops deep feelings for Mira, an AI entity he created. This relationship sparks numerous debates and reflections on societal and moral levels.
Every subtle interaction between humans and AI makes us rethink: What constitutes a genuine emotional connection in an era intertwined with AI? What sparks will fly when love encounters artificial intelligence? In the future, with the advancement of technology, how will human love evolve?
