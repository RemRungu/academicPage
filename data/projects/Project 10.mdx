## An Modern Dance and New Media Art Performance

N Generations - is a performance that integrates modern dance and digital art, inspired by the ancient Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi is known for his profound insights into the nature of reality, human existence, and freedom. He advocated for a life of spontaneity, harmony, and detachment from worldly affairs. In contrast, modern society is full of stress, anxiety, and materialism. We want to use this performance to explore how Zhuangziâ€™s philosophy can help us cope with the challenges of our times and find inner peace and balance.
