## A New Media Symphony in Hong Kong Coliseum

“Every instrument invented by our ancestors carries a story, and every story holds a piece of history. When an instrument disappears, its story fades away, leaving history fragmented...” - Tan Dun. Sound River is a visionary project by renowned contemporary composer and conductor Tan Dun, born from a 12-year journey tracing the rich tapestry of human civilization. Through the lens of 16 short films, Tan Dun explores the vanishing sounds, instruments, and cultural narratives of ancient cities along the Silk Road, from Europe to the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.
