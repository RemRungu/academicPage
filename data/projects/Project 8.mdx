## An Opera and Dance Theatre

A performance filled with primitivism and ritualistic elements. The opening piece of the performance, "Shaman Tea Ritual", originates from the ritual music and dance of a Yunnan ethnic minority. It echoes the final part of the programme, "The Rite of Spring", a dance theatre choreographed by the renowned choreographer Yang Liping, paying tribute to the century-old Western classic by famous composer Stravinsky through oriental dance and body language. The opening piece is followed by Tan Dun's two mini operas “Deer of Nine Colours” and “ Heart Sutra” which is a pairing of Western symphony with oriental Buddhist spirit, exemplifying the vocal power and the ancient music of Dunhuang that transcend language barriers, to reminisce about the thousand years of Chinese culture.  Yang Liping and Tan Dun will share their rich artistic journey with the audience in the Dialogue with Demonstration at the beginning of the performance.
