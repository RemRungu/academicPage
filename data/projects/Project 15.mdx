## An Immersive Visual Artwork Inspired by Guangzhou’s Revolutionary History

Guangzhou is a heroic city that witnessed many significant events in China’s revolutionary history. In this artwork, we select some of the classic red sites in Guangzhou as the basis for our immersive visual art. Using architectural aesthetics and spatial narrative, we tell the historical stories of these sites, recalling the glorious years and paying tribute to the centennial journey of the Chinese Communist Party.
To create this artwork, we collaborate with a heritage preservation company called “Fangyu” in Guangzhou. They provide us with point cloud data of the red sites, which are usually used for architectural history preservation. Point cloud data are sets of 3D points that represent the shape and color of an object or a scene. We use a scanner that consists of a rotating platform, a 360-degree laser radar and a 360-degree full-color camera to capture the point cloud data of the red sites.
This arkwork integrates point cloud data and particle simulation techniques, call VFG (Visual Effect Graph) in Unity. We reconstruct the architectural space with the image of ‘sparks of fire’, a metaphor for the revolutionary spirit and the origin of the Party. The sparks of fire from the red landmarks such as the Peasant Movement Institute, the Guangzhou Commune, the former site of the National Labor Conference, the Dongyuan Cultural Square, the former site of the CPC Guangdong Regional Committee, and the Haizhu Square Memorial Sculpture bloom around the viewers, dancing with the music, and enveloping everyone in this historical time and space.
