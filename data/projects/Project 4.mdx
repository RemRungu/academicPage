## Dancing with(in) Your Bio-data

”Dancing with(in) Your Bio-Body” is an art project at the intersection of dance, technology, and cognitive science. It introduces the concept of ’Bio-body’, a dynamic digital embodiment of the dancer’s physiological state, rendered in real-timeusing EEG, motion capture, and visualization technologies. The project offers two unique interactive experiences: ’Dancing within your Bio-body’, which immerses dancers in theirown inner space, and ’Dancing with your Bio-body’, creatinga bio-digital mirror for enhanced performance. This integration of bio-data with artistic expression transcends traditional neurofeedback, delve into the realm of embodied cognition. The paper presents the development of the bio-body, exploring how dancers can engage with their bio-data to amplify awareness and augment performance. This research contributes to the evolving understanding of dance, positioning it within a broader context of interdisciplinary artistic exploration that fuses human cognition, creativity, and digital technology.
