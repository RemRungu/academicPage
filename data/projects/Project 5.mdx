## An AI and Data-Driven Approach to Real-Time Animation for Public Digital Art

“Urban Symphony” is an artwork that uses animation and projection mapping to illuminate nine silos at an industrial heritage site in central Shenzhen. It was displayed during the opening ceremony of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Bi-City Biennale of Urbanism\Architecture 2023 (Figure 1). The installation combines human creativity, AI capabilities, and data-driven insights to create a immersive public art display that tells the story of Shenzhen’s urban transformation and its pivotal role in China’s reform and opening up.
“Urban Symphony” consists of three chapters, each featuring geometric elements, city buildings, and brass instruments. These chapters depict Shenzhen’s stages of development - its initial construction, urban expansion, and cultural flourishing. The geometric elements are abstract expressions inspired by architectural structures and brass instruments, representing the key factors of the city’s development. The city buildings are iconic landmarks that reflect the city’s architectural achievements, and the brass instruments are deconstructed and reassembled to symbolize the city’s cultural vitality. The installation creates a semi-enclosed space that invites audiences to experience both visually and auditorily. It encourages viewers to contemplate the city’s evolution and their own position within this dynamic city.
