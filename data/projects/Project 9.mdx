## An Modern Dance and New Media Art Performance

“The Resonance of Light” is the opening show of the 2019 Shenzhen-Hong Kong Urban Architecture Biennale in Guangming District. The performance expresses the harmonious unity of people, nature, city and all things through abstract artistic forms. The connection of individuals triggers the resonance of multiple spaces. We sometimes wander in rivers and mountains, and sometimes float in urban space. The audience is invited to enter the narrative field created by the atrium of the exhibition hall, look up at the starry sky, and merge with heaven and earth. In the aftermath of dance, light and shadow, and notes, they continue to imagine the beautiful future of urban life.
